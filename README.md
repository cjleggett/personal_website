# Personal Website

### Purpose:
This website is intended to give people just a little bit of information about me including my interests and work experience.

### Technology:
* I've decided to make this a static site as there's really not much reason for visitors of the site to enter information unless they want to get in touch with me via emal
* I decided to use react in the creation of the site to get a bit more practice using the technology, and also to avoid the entire site being reloaded every time a user changes pages.
* I've hosted the site using Netlify with a domain name bought on NameCheap

### Access:
Check out the site at [www.connorleggett.net](www.connorleggett.net)
